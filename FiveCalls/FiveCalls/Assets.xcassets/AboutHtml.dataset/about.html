      <h3 class="about__subtitle">Why Calling Works</h3>

      <p>Calling members of Congress is the most effective way to have your voice heard. Calls are tallied by staffers and the count is given to your representatives, informing them how strongly their constituents feel about a current issue. The sooner your reach out, the more likely it is that <strong>your voice will influence their position.</strong></p>
      <p>Don’t just take it from us:</p>

      <p><i>5 Calls</i> does the research for each issue, determining out which representatives are most influential for which topic, collecting phone numbers for those offices and writing scripts that clearly articulate a progressive position. You just have to call.</p>
      <p>Are we not covering an issue we should be?  <a href="mailto:make5calls@gmail.com">Please reach out.</a></p>

      <h3 class="about__subtitle">Calling Tips</h3>
      <p>Calls should take less than a minute. You’ll be speaking to a staffer, so make your point clearly so they can tally your opinion correctly. The provided scripts are useful but you can add your own words.</p>
      <p>Be respectful. The staffers that pick up the phone aren’t looking to challenge you and you should treat them with the same respect you expect from them, regardless of which party they work for.</p>

      <h3 class="about__subtitle">Who made 5 Calls?</h3>
