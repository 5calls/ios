			<string>&lt;p&gt;Kingfisher is a lightweight and pure Swift implemented library for downloading and cacheing image from the web. It provides you a chance to use pure Swift alternation in your next app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything in Kingfisher goes asynchronously, not only downloading, but also caching. That means you can never worry about blocking your UI thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple-layer cache. Downloaded image will be cached in both memory and disk. So there is no need to download it again and this could boost your app dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache management. You can set the max duration or size the cache could take. And the cache will also be cleaned automatically to prevent taking too much resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern framework. Kingfisher uses &lt;code&gt;NSURLSession&lt;/code&gt; and the latest technology of GCD, which makes it a strong and swift framework. It also provides you easy APIs to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancellable processing task. You can cancel the downloading or retriving image process if it is not needed anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent components. You can use the downloader or caching system separately. Or even create your own cache based on Kingfisher&amp;#39;s code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options to decompress the image in background before render it, which could improve the UI performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A category over &lt;code&gt;UIImageView&lt;/code&gt; for setting image from an url directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
