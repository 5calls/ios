			<string>&lt;p&gt;R.swift is a tool to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never type string identifiers again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports images, fonts, storyboards, nibs, segues, reuse identifiers and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile time checks and errors instead of runtime crashes&lt;/li&gt;
