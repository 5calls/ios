			<string>&lt;p&gt;Visual Studio App Center is your continuous integration, delivery and learning solution for iOS and macOS apps.
Get faster release cycles, higher-quality apps, and the insights to build what users want.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The App Center SDK uses a modular architecture so you can use any or all of the following services:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Center Analytics (iOS and macOS):
App Center Analytics helps you understand user behavior and customer engagement to improve your app. The SDK automatically captures session count, device properties like model, OS version, etc. You can define your own custom events to measure things that matter to you. All the information captured is available in the App Center portal for you to analyze the data.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Center Crashes (iOS and macOS):
App Center Crashes will automatically generate a crash log every time your app crashes. The log is first written to the device&amp;#39;s storage and when the user starts the app again, the crash report will be sent to App Center. Collecting crashes works for both beta and live apps, i.e. those submitted to the App Store. Crash logs contain valuable information for you to help fix the crash.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Center Distribute (iOS only):
App Center Distribute lets your users install a new version of the app when you distribute it with App Center. With a new version of the app available, the SDK will present an update dialog to the users to either download or postpone the new version. Once they choose to update, the SDK will start to update your application. This feature is automatically disabled on versions of your app deployed to the Apple App Store.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Center Push (iOS and macOS):
App Center Push enables you to send push notifications to users of your app from the App Center portal. You can also segment your user base based on a set of properties and send them targeted notifications.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Center Data (iOS only):
The App Center Data service provides functionality enabling developers to persist app data in the cloud in both online and offline scenarios. This enables you to store and manage both user-specific data as well as data shared between users and across platforms.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;App Center Auth (iOS only):
App Center Auth is a cloud-based identity management service that enables developers to authenticate application users and manage user identities. The service integrates with other parts of App Center, enabling developers to leverage the user identity to view user data in other services and even send push notifications to users instead of individual devices.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

			<string>&lt;p&gt;Kingfisher is a lightweight and pure Swift implemented library for downloading and cacheing image from the web. It provides you a chance to use pure Swift alternation in your next app.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Everything in Kingfisher goes asynchronously, not only downloading, but also caching. That means you can never worry about blocking your UI thread.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Multiple-layer cache. Downloaded image will be cached in both memory and disk. So there is no need to download it again and this could boost your app dramatically.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cache management. You can set the max duration or size the cache could take. And the cache will also be cleaned automatically to prevent taking too much resource.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Modern framework. Kingfisher uses &lt;code&gt;NSURLSession&lt;/code&gt; and the latest technology of GCD, which makes it a strong and swift framework. It also provides you easy APIs to use.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Cancellable processing task. You can cancel the downloading or retriving image process if it is not needed anymore.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Independent components. You can use the downloader or caching system separately. Or even create your own cache based on Kingfisher&amp;#39;s code.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Options to decompress the image in background before render it, which could improve the UI performance.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;A category over &lt;code&gt;UIImageView&lt;/code&gt; for setting image from an url directly.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<string>&lt;p&gt;R.swift is a tool to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never type string identifiers again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports images, fonts, storyboards, nibs, segues, reuse identifiers and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile time checks and errors instead of runtime crashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<string>&lt;p&gt;This library contains types used by the &lt;code&gt;R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; file that is normally generated by R.swift. R.swift depends on this pod to include some types and other libraries can use this project to extend R.swift types.&lt;/p&gt;
