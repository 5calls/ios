			<string>&lt;p&gt;R.swift is a tool to get strong typed, autocompleted resources like images, fonts and segues in Swift projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Never type string identifiers again&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Supports images, fonts, storyboards, nibs, segues, reuse identifiers and more&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Compile time checks and errors instead of runtime crashes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

			<string>&lt;p&gt;This library contains types used by the &lt;code&gt;R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; file that is normally generated by R.swift. R.swift depends on this pod to include some types and other libraries can use this project to extend R.swift types.&lt;/p&gt;
